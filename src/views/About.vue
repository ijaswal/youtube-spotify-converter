      I love programming and am always looking for a new experience that gives me a chance to grow as a software engineer. If you'd like to reach out to me for such an opportunity, you can always

    <p>When I'm not programming, you can probably find me playing video games, watching the newest Netflix series, or playing a terrible game of basketball!</p>
